# Welcome to Our Project: Unknown

We are making a mobile social media platform where users will be able to post audio clips OR text for other local users to view, up/downvote, and comment/create discussion threads on. The user posts that will be visible to the user will be based on locality; some defined radius from you will determine which posts are available, ex: if a post was made within 5 miles from me, I will be able to see it until I'm > 5 miles away from where that post was made.
